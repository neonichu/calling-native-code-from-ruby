# Calling Native Code from Ruby

This talk gives a quick introduction into the not so well known Fiddle, which has been a part of MRI since 1.9. It allows direct interaction with C code via a Foreign Function Interface, which enables wrapping native code without compiling C extensions, making the lives of users of your projects much easier.
