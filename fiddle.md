## We want to use some existing native library or system functionality

## We don't want a C extension

```ruby
require 'fiddle'

image = Fiddle.dlopen(PATH)
function = Fiddle::Function.new(image[symbol], parameter_types, return_type)
result = function.call(a, b, c)
```

## Types

- Fiddle::TYPE_VOID
- Fiddle::TYPE_INT
- Fiddle::TYPE_CHAR
- Fiddle::TYPE_VOIDP
- ...

## Use `Fiddle::Handle.new` to refer to our own binary
